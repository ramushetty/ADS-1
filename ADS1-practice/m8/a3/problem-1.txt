E A S Y Q U E S T I O N

first it will take E and then iterate all from A to N
	from A to N A is less than E so E is replaced by A and new Sequence will be 
	A E S Y Q U E S T I O N

A E S Y Q U E S T I O N 
	now pointer starts from E and then iterate through S to N
	from S to N nothing  is less than E so E is not replaced by anything
	A E S Y Q U E S T I O N 
A E S Y Q U E S T I O N 
	now pointer starts from s and then iterate through Y to N
	from Y to N S is less than E so E is replaced by S and new Sequence will be 
	A E E Y Q U S S T I O N
By doing this we get a final sequence in ascending order as 
=======================================
A, E, E, I, N, O, Q, S, S, T, U, Y	======
